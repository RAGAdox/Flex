            <h3>Time Flies</h3>
            <p>
              I was born in '67 The year of Sgt. Pepper And are you experienced
              Into a suburban heaven Yeah it should've been forever It all seems
              to make so much sense But after a while You realize time flies And
              the best thing that you can do Is take whatever comes to you
              'Cause time flies She said luck is what you make it You just reach
              out and take it Now let's dance a while She said nothing ever
              happens If you don't make it happen And if you can't laugh and
              smile But after a while You realize time flies And the best thing
              that you can do Is take whatever comes to you 'Cause time flies
              And laughing in the summer showers That's still the way I see you
              now How does time break down With no marker, things slow down. A
              conference of the strange And your family is deranged
